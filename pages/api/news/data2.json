The Nottinghamshire pacer bowed out as a result of the shoulder injury that saw him miss the club's 2020 T20 Blast campaign. The time has arrived for me to hang up my boots. After trying to recover from the recent injury to my shoulder, I am truly disappointed to have to end my playing career as a result of it, Gurney captioned a post on Instagram to announce his retirement.",

However, the depth and quality of leadership in the CSK squad cannot be underestimated for long and with the return of a rejuvenated Dhoni in their ranks, the franchise will aim to regain their authority and script another epic journey this season.",
